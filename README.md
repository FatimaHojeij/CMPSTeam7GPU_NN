gpu0 - represents the naive implementation\n
gpu1 - is the optimization of gpu0 using intra-warp synchronization
gpu2 - optimization of gpu0 using thread coarsening
gpu3 - optimization of gpu0 using privitization
gpu4 - optimizations 1 and 2 combined
gpu5 - optimizations 1 and 3 combined


The naive implementation using skeleton code the dr provided can be found at:
